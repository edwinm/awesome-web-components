In addition, test files are run in parallel as separate processes, giving you even better performance and an isolated environment for each test file. from Mocha to AVA in Pageres brought the test time down from 31 to 11 seconds. Having tests run concurrently forces you to write atomic tests, meaning tests don't depend on global state or the state of other tests, which is a great thing!](https://github.com/avajs/ava)
